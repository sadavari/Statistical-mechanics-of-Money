# Statistical-mechanics-of-Money
A Monte Carlo approach for obtaining the distribution of money in large systems
The distribution of money in a large system was analyzed by solving a  stochastic differential equation(SDE) using Monte Carlo method.
The model starts with man agents that have the same amount of money.
The agents start to interact with each other randomly.
During the interactions they either gain money or lose.
After the system reaches to an equilibrium, the distribution of money among the agents were analyzed.
The system essentially solves the Fokkerâ€“Planck equation and shows Boltzamann distribution among the agents.
